More art than tech but a significant amount of work regardless.  Created an origami design based upon a modified version pre-existing flower, then took that design and placed it into an array of flowers similar to a lilac blossom.  The modifications that had to be made were due in a large part to the fact that I was working with aluminum foil and metal is very unforgiving when folded.
