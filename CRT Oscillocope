A very early venture into circuitry, the term Oscilloscope is used very losely here.  This project wasn't anything fancy but it did take input from a 1/4 inch mono or stereo aplified audio jack and use it to create a display on a portable CRT.  It had 3 modes of display which were togglable via a switch.  These modes were: dot with verticle bump, Horizontal Wave (standard), and Circular (stereo).  Functionally, all this switch did was redirect the amplified signal into the desired deflection coil.  With that said, it was a great introduction to modifying pre-existing circuitry.
