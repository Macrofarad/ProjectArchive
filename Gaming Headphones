Used parts from a bunch of broken gaming headphones in order to make a decent working set.  Involved a bit of soldering, troubleshooting, and 3d printing.  The project also produced a schematic for a set of usb headphones based on the schematics of various headphone manufacturers which I may build should the need ever arise.  With that said, the schematic is buried in papers currently so it may not see the light of day for some time yet.
