This project was a failure.  While the premise was good, the tubing I used was too small in diameter and the additional strain that caused on the pump ended up causing mild shocks to the fish (for the record, these shocks were not perceptable on human skin, but very likely disturbed the fishs' sensory organs).  Needless to say, this project was scrapped quickly as harming living things is something that should be avoided whenever possible.
