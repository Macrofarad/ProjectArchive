A five volt power supply intended for usage in digital circuits.  It was made by canablizing old usb chargers so that I could work on my circuits from home

Name is from the fact that I added a power light that would give it a blue glow when powered on.  The circuit was placed into a small 1x0.5 inch clear tube and had banana plug output.
