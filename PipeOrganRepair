Found a pipe organ head unit at a good will, it fell out of a truck and was in rough shape.

I repaired the circuitry and working hardware to revitalize it.

Was a fun project but it did end up having to be scrapped in the end due to the fact that I didn't have the tools or funds neccissary to repair the exterior.  Also, it's very difficult to move a piano that is nearly solid metal from place to place
