No important conclusions came about from this project, but it was fun.  Took a bunch of audio samples which included tuvan throat singing and created spectrograph images of them as well as compared them at the wave level to other types of audio samples.  Other than the images, the most interesting observation was that in many cases, Tuvan throat singing ended up resembling autitory illusions such as the tri-tone paradox when viewed at a fairly close level.
