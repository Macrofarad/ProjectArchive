Desktop computer was built in 2008-9, finally here in 2018 it has begun to give out

Revitalized it by making it an unraid server for data storage and minor virtualization

Eventual plan is to migrate to a dedicated virtualization server instead of Windows, Linux, etc.  Currently doing most of my work, projects and so forth in Virtual machines so it's a pretty natural transition from my end.  

Examples of VM's from the time of this writing: Project; Work; School; Androidx86_64; Internet.  Each of these is tailored to a specific purpose to help keep me on task.
